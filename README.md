# Red Webbing #

  This game uses python with pygame to create an interactive connect puzzle game that can have multiple players. It originally started as a submission for the Extra Credits Game Jam #4 and therefore is inspired by the game jam's theme 'connect'. However this game has since been developed further.

## Set-up Instructions:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install pygame by running `pip3 install pygame` in your command line.
3. Run `python3 game.py` in your command line to start the game.

## Game Rules:

* Create the most amount of connections with your lines as you can.
  * You can only connect to dots of your colour.
  * You can not create a line that goes through an existing line.
* Try to prevent other players from creating connections by blocking their dots.
